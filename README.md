# food-delivery-service

An app that acts as a bridge between restaurants and customers

## Description

This application should be able to form a bridge between restaurants and consumers. Restaurants owners must be able to sign up and list out their food items along with the price. Users must be able to sign up, view the restaurants nearby and order food items from selected restaurants.

Restaurants should accept the order and assign a delivery person to the order. The location of the delivery person and the dynamic ETA of delivery must be displayed to the user who ordered food. The cart and payment page must be unique across the full application.
